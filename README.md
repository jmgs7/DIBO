# DIBO
The DrugInterBank Ontology (DIBO) offers consensus knowledge about the different functional and structural aspects of a drug, but more specifically on its interaction with other molecules. On the one hand, it models the main physicochemical characteristics of a drug, such as the half-life, its formula and molecular mass and nomenclatures. It also includes information on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, modeling both the metabolism and the mechanism of action.
